## About Wallet Tracker API

Wallet Tracker API is a comprehensive solution that centralizes and manages family financial data from multiple sources. It provides endpoints for handling families, users, accounts, payers, transactions, and account balances, enabling complete financial control without being tied to a single financial institution.

The system integrates with QStash for reliable message queuing in WhatsApp transaction processing, ensuring robust handling of OCR operations and financial data extraction.

## Architectural Pattern

The Wallet Tracker API follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate to services
- **Services**: Contain business logic and rules
- **Repositories**: Responsible for data persistence and querying
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects with Zod validation
- **Middlewares**: Input validation and error handling
- **Queue System**: QStash integration for WhatsApp transaction processing

## Environment Configuration

Configure your environment variables in the .env file:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database

# QStash Configuration
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=your_current_signing_key
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=your_next_signing_key
```

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Generate Prisma client
yarn prisma:generate

# Run database migrations
yarn prisma:migrate

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

## API Endpoints

Wallet Tracker API is organized into 6 main resource controllers:

- `/api/v1/families` - Family management operations including creation, updates, and user/account associations
- `/api/v1/users` - User management within families, including profile and contact information
- `/api/v1/accounts` - Account management for different types (Credit, Debit, Meal vouchers, etc.)
- `/api/v1/payers` - Payment source management for transaction attribution
- `/api/v1/transactions` - Complete transaction management with filtering and installments
- `/api/v1/balances` - Account balance tracking with competence date management
- `/api/v1/monthly-closures` - Monthly closure management for balance reconciliation

## Key Features

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation for all endpoints
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dependency injection

### Reliability & Performance
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing of WhatsApp transaction integration
